# Introduction

This is a basic book (or article) builder template based on a Pandoc build process in conjunction with a number of other tools to generate PDF, ODT, HTML, LaTex, Markdown, and Epub book output formats from Markdown source content , which can optionally be edited as an Obsidian vault.

This book builder template has been  curated by John Haverlack.[@JohnHaverlackACEP]

## Conventions

A few callout box styles have been added to easily highlight content.
